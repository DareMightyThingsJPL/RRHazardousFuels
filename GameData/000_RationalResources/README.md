"Play mode" system is decided here. The purpose of each folder is to reflect the resource library of your choice and each one contains a version of the resource templates -- the collections of combinations of resource placements. Be sure to only have one of these play mode folders or they will cause overlap and quite a lot of needless work for ModuleManager.

> :star: Create your own play mode folder if you would like to use Rational Resources to roll out your own set of resources. Rational Resources Companion will not immediately function with new play modes. Feel free to clone the matched play mode folder in there and update the detections to make it work.
