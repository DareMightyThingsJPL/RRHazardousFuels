"Play mode" system is decided here. The purpose of each folder (other than `zShared` which is play mode agnostic) is to reflect the resource library of your choice and each one contains a version of the resource templates -- the collections of combinations of resource placements. Be sure to only have one of these play mode folders or they will cause overlap and quite a lot of needless work for ModuleManager.

> :star: Create your own play mode folder if you would like to use CRP or another resource library in your own way.
