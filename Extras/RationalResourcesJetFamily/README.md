This modlet enables all supported chemical jet engines to choose between LiquidFuel and some CRP fuels. The following engine scenarios are supported:
- **Default**: Single-mode engines. Also covers dual-mode "afterburner" engines where both modes use LiquidFuel.
- **Combined Cycle**: Dual-mode engines where the 2nd mod is a rocket's closed cycle.
- **Hybrid Electric**: Dual-mode engines where the 2nd mod is an electric engine. ElectricCharge demand is increased for these. Be prepared to pack a beefy power source.
