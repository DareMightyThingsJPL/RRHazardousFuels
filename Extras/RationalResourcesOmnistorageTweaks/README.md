# Rational Resources Omnistorage Tweaks
This mod addresses a long standing issue of mine with Omnistorage (a fuel switch/tank partition plugin within Wild Blue Industries). It adjusts the `volume` keys of resource definitions (nearly all of the ones in the WBI mods and the stock propellants) to remove the savage tankage penalty that applies to them versus tanks that don't use the Omnistorage plugin. This would, by design, break the established balance of the existing Omnistorage tanks in the WBI mods themselves so this modlet is to forever be treated as optional. The creator of the WBI mods, @Angel-125, might even like this, but we'll see.
